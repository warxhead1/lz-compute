# Remote CLI Interface - Initial Phases Requirements

## Overview
The Remote CLI Interface is a locally-hosted application that enables phones, remote computers, and other devices to manage and develop on remote machines without a GUI. This specification covers the initial MVP phases focusing on core functionality with a native terminal feel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Terminal Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access and control my local development machine's terminal from any device with a web browser, so that I can code and manage systems remotely without a GUI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the web interface THEN the system SHALL display an interactive terminal emulator with full ANSI support
2. WHEN a user types commands in the terminal THEN the system SHALL execute them with sub-100ms latency for native feel
3. IF the terminal output exceeds the visible area THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling with output history
4. WHEN a user executes long-running commands THEN the system SHALL stream output in real-time without blocking
5. IF a command requires user input THEN the system SHALL properly handle stdin/stdout/stderr streams
6. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+C or other control sequences THEN the system SHALL correctly translate and send appropriate signals

### Requirement 2: Multi-Session Management

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to create and manage multiple concurrent terminal sessions, so that I can work on different tasks simultaneously without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new session THEN the system SHALL spawn an isolated shell process with unique session ID
2. IF a user switches between sessions THEN the system SHALL preserve the state and output of all sessions
3. WHEN a session is inactive THEN the system SHALL continue buffering output up to a configurable limit
4. IF a user closes a browser tab THEN the system SHALL keep sessions alive for reconnection
5. WHEN a user terminates a session THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all associated resources
6. IF the system has multiple active sessions THEN the UI SHALL display visual indicators for session activity

### Requirement 3: Cross-Platform Shell Support

**User Story:** As a cross-platform developer, I want to use different shell types (bash, cmd, PowerShell, WSL) depending on my project needs, so that I can work with platform-specific tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a session on Linux/macOS THEN the system SHALL offer bash, zsh, and fish shell options
2. WHEN creating a session on Windows THEN the system SHALL offer cmd, PowerShell, and WSL options
3. IF WSL is available on Windows THEN the system SHALL provide seamless WSL bridge integration
4. WHEN executing platform-specific commands THEN the system SHALL handle path translation and environment variables correctly
5. IF a shell type is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the system default shell
6. WHEN switching between shell types THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the new environment

### Requirement 4: Real-Time WebSocket Communication

**User Story:** As a remote user, I want responsive real-time interaction with the terminal, so that I can work efficiently without noticeable delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing a connection THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket protocol with automatic reconnection
2. IF the WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
3. WHEN reconnecting after disconnection THEN the system SHALL restore session state and display buffered output
4. IF WebSocket is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. WHEN transmitting large output THEN the system SHALL use binary WebSocket frames for optimal performance
6. IF network latency exceeds 100ms THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators to the user

### Requirement 5: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my terminal sessions to be secure and accessible only from authorized devices, so that my system remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in local-only mode THEN the system SHALL reject all non-localhost connections
2. IF sensitive data patterns are detected in output THEN the system SHALL optionally filter or mask them
3. WHEN establishing a session THEN the system SHALL require authentication via JWT tokens
4. IF multiple failed authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol when configured
6. IF security events occur THEN the system SHALL log them to an audit trail

### Requirement 6: Mobile-Responsive Interface

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to effectively use the terminal interface on my phone or tablet, so that I can manage systems on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a touch-optimized interface
2. IF the screen size is small THEN the system SHALL offer virtual keyboard integration with proper key mappings
3. WHEN using touch gestures THEN the system SHALL support pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-scroll
4. IF the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust the terminal dimensions
5. WHEN typing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback and auto-correct bypass
6. IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL optimize for low-bandwidth operation

### Requirement 7: Command History and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my command history and session data to persist between connections, so that I can resume work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing commands THEN the system SHALL store them in a searchable history database
2. IF a user presses up/down arrows THEN the system SHALL navigate through command history
3. WHEN searching history with Ctrl+R THEN the system SHALL provide interactive reverse search
4. IF a session is restored THEN the system SHALL reload the working directory and environment
5. WHEN storing sensitive commands THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings for exclusion
6. IF storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup of old data

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to efficiently manage resources, so that it can handle many concurrent sessions without degrading performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times
2. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement output pagination and compression
3. WHEN sessions are idle THEN the system SHALL reduce resource consumption through intelligent throttling
4. IF CPU usage is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize active sessions over background ones
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for latency, throughput, and resource usage
6. IF resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully reject new sessions with clear messaging

### Requirement 9: Basic Configuration Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure system behavior and defaults, so that the interface meets my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables and config files
2. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring restart where possible
3. WHEN setting defaults THEN the system SHALL allow shell type, theme, and security preferences
4. IF invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults with warning logs
5. WHEN saving user preferences THEN the system SHALL store them per-user in the database
6. IF configuration conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL follow a clear precedence order

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and help me recover from issues, so that I can maintain productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
2. IF a shell process crashes THEN the system SHALL offer to restart the session with preserved state
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL queue commands and retry with user notification
4. IF database errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue operating with degraded persistence
5. WHEN unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL log full context without exposing sensitive data
6. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail safely without compromising security or data
